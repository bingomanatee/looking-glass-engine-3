# Looking Glass Engine 3.0

This is a rebuild of LGE 3; no backwards compatibility with 2.0 is delivered though an adaptive class might be added at 
some point. The goal of this rebuild is a smaller footprint more opinionated system with more dependency on streams
and the smallest possible dependency pool.
